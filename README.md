# Titanic Predictable Passengers

Welcome to Scratch That Titanic Predictable Passengers! This project is focused on using machine learning algorithms to predict which passengers on the Titanic survived.

## Features

- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms to make predictions
- Training of the models on the Titanic passenger dataset
- Comparison of the performance of each model to determine the best-performing algorithm

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seabron
- Scikit-learn
- Titanic passenger dataset
